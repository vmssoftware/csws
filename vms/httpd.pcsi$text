The OpenVMS Installation and Configuration Guide gives detailed directions.
This information is a brief checklist.


Configure OpenVMS aspects of the web server by:

    $ @SYS$MANAGER:APACHE$CONFIG

If the OpenVMS username APACHE$WWW does not exist, you will be
prompted to create that username.  File ownerships are set to UIC
[APACHE$WWW], etc.

After configuration, start the web server manually by entering:

    $ @SYS$STARTUP:APACHE$STARTUP

Check that neither SYLOGIN.COM nor the LOGIN.COM write any output to
SYS$OUTPUT:.  Look especially for a

    $ SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE.

Start the web server at system boot time by adding the following
lines to SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

    $ file := SYS$STARTUP:APACHE$STARTUP.COM
    $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'

Shutdown the Apache server at system shutdown time by adding the
following lines to SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM:

    $ file := SYS$STARTUP:APACHE$SHUTDOWN.COM
    $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'

Test the installation using your favorite Web browser.
Replace host.domain in the following URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
with the information for the web server just installed, configured,
and started.

URL http://host.domain/ should display the standard introductory page
from the Apache Software Foundation. This has the bold text "It
Works!" If you do not see this page, check the release notes.

If you'd like to use secure connections then you'll need to create
a server certificate.  We recommend that you start by creating a 30
day self-signed certificate using the following certificate tool:

    $ @APACHE$COMMON:[OPENSSL.COM]OPENSSL_AUTO_CERT.COM

Once the certificate has been created you'll need to uncomment the
following directive in the APACHE$COMMON:[CONF]HTTPD.CONF file to
enable SSL.

    Include /apache$root/conf/ssl.conf

Thank you for using the Secure Web Server.
